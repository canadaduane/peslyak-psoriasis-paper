# What is this project? #
An attempt to make sense of a very interesting paper on [Psoriasis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis) called "[Model of pathogenesis of psoriasis](http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.0584)", published first in Russian, and then in English.

The online version of these notes can be accessed [here](http://canadaduane.github.com/peslyak-psoriasis-paper/Peslyak-P1.html).

## Is it a retranslation? ##
Not really. While I have taken editorial liberties in making certain places sound more like colloquial English, I'm not really attempting a retranslation. For starters, I don't know Russian. And secondarily, I don't know the author. Rather, I want to be more of a student of Mikhail Peslyak's paper, and so this project is an attempt to understand enough of his paper so that I can make sense of it, and perhaps help myself or others who have psoriatic symptoms (e.g. arthritic, epidermic, or otherwise).

## What's your background? ##
I don't have a degree in microbiology. In fact, I'm not a biologist. I'm a software developer. But I have taken classes in biology, microbiology and bioinformatics, so I have a very basic knowledge of concepts. The web is a wonderful thing, however, and I'm confident that I will be able to get through this paper with the help of external resources (Wikipedia, the apple of my eye--I donated to you last year!)

## Can I contribute? ##
Of course! If you care about this subject and are self-motivated, feel free to open "issues" if I have something wrong, and I'll correct it. Or add to the wiki if you would like to elucidate some concept, and then I can link to the expanded topic.
