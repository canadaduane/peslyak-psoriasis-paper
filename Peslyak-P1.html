			<dd>The paper points to "epidermal hyperproliferation" as the direct cause of skin lesions (red, flaky, etc.) and identifies that when skin cells grow too quickly, they detach from the matrix material that connects skin tissue together, causing early cell death ("anoikis", i.e. a form of apoptosis or programmed cell death).</dd>

			<dd>The paper's abstract notes that psoriatic cells go from a normal 311 hour lifecycle to 36 hours, and that the cell density of plaques is twice the number per millimeter. When combined, these factors correspond to a 28-fold increase in skin cell production.</dd>

				The self-renewal of the epidermis is a normal process: New cells are born in the basal layer; they mature, vary, and migrate toward the outside and form the external cornified layer; then, they die away and exfoliate. The standard lifecycle of an epidermal cell for areas of skin with average thickness (the renewal period) is 20-25 days. Psoriasis accelerates self-renewal&mdash;cells live only 4-10 days (<a class="note" href="http://www.amazon.com/Recent-Advances-Psoriasis-Immune-System/dp/1860941206/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1326141641&sr=8-1">Baker 2000</a>, <a class="note" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15265521">Iizuka 2004</a>, <a class="note" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4067329">Weinstein 1985</a>). Cells migrating outside have no time to differentiate and they aren't quite functional. Psoriatic plaques have a red shade&mdash;they are tender, covered by white flakes due to the accelerated loss of cells, and they are much thicker.

Chronic plaque psoriasis (CPs) is the most frequent type (more than 80% of total number of cases). Up to 15% of psoriatics also suffer from <a href="http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/L40.5">psoriatic arthritis (L40.5)</a>. Psoriasis is present in about 2-3% of the human population (120-180 million people). 4-6 million people are newly diagnosed with psoriasis every year. The disease can appear at birth or in extreme old age. Psoriasis is a chronic disease, so there are periods of aggravation and remission. Sometimes there appears to be no cause for periods of remission, and sometimes aggravation can be decreased as a result of treatment. Serious psoriasis can result in disability. The onset and progress of psoriasis is similar in men and women. African Americans, Indians, Chinese and Japanese suffer from psoriasis less frequently, however, and Eskimos don't suffer from psoriasis at all (<a class="note" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16734342">Piruzian 2006</a>, <a class="note" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15180465">Giardina 2004</a>).

				Psoriasis is registered in the "Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man" as <a href="http://omim.org/entry/177900">OMIM*177900</a>. Psoriasis is a disease with a hereditary predisposition: concordance between <i>uniovular twins</i> is 70%. If one parent suffers from psoriasis, children are diagnosed with the disease in 15-25% of cases; if both parents suffer from psoriasis children are diagnosed with the disease in more than 40-60% of cases. The interrelation of <a href="http://omim.org/entry/142840#0001">allele HLA-Cw*0602</a> (chromosome 6p21) and psoriasis of the first type (characterized by its early beginning) has been demonstrated (<a class="note" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12362037">Weisenseel 2002</a>). This allele is found in more than 60% of psoriatics (not more than 15% of healthy people). Locuses of other chromosomes have weaker interrelations (Piruzian 2006, Giardina 2004). Psoriasis never manifests only in the presence of genetic defects&mdash;external exposure is necessary for the beginning and maintenance of psoriasis. Infections, skin traumas, stress, reaction to medications, climatic changes and other causes can provoke the onset of psoriasis or its aggravation (Molochkov 2007, Bos 2005, Fry 2007b, Gudjonsson 2004).

Peptidoglycan is an "enemy protein" most commonly found in the cell wall of foreign bacteria such as streptococci. So if the PG recognizers are not specifically tuned for PG, there's a chance the body can erroneously target its own cells, which have similar traits.</dd>

				<dt><i>R-phagocytes</i>: "Reprogrammed phagocytes"</dt>
				<dd>Phagocytes are white blood cells that eat harmful foreign particles. "Reprogrammed" in this context means they have two main properties:
					<ol>
						<li>Despite contact, linkage with PAMP and endocytosis of PAMP (as a part of endocytosed F-content) their chemostatus similar to nonactivated</li>
						<li>Degradation of endocytosed F-content is slow and incomplete act so essential kPAMP part remains (kPAMP-carriage)</li>
					</ol>

					All tolerized phagocytes have Property 1. Property 2 depends on parity between rate of endocytosis F and intracellular proteolytic activity.

				There are references where the subprocess has been proven and/or described in detail, or where the hypothesis has been summarized (see Appendix 3). The Systemic Psoriatic Process (SPP) and the hypothesis regarding the <i>chemostatus</i> of reprogrammed <i>R-phagocytes</i> are essentially new.
